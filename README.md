# Python-Simple
This repository is for people who want to learn python.
This repository contains files that I have created while learning python.
The python code in these files is well documented, and you should read comments to better understand that what is the purpose of a specific statement.
I prefer that you should run files, and compare the output of the files with the code and read the comment to understand that what statement produces what output.
Each file is numbered. So follow the order for better understanding of code.
For more informations, see Python official documentation.
